# Hi there, I'm Naitik! 👋

I'm a creative thinker and a passionate **designer and content creator** from India. I love bringing concepts to life, whether it's through dynamic video editing or clean, impactful graphic design. This passion for building and presenting ideas was sparked during my experience competing in hackathons, where I learned to quickly design and pitch solutions as part of a team.

---

* 🏆 **Hackathon Experience:** I was part of **Team Sankalp** at the Smart BU Hackathon. We designed and pitched "Edify," a timetable scheduling solution, where my primary role was crafting the visual presentation and the final pitch.

* 🎨 **I’m currently building:** My design portfolio with a focus on video editing, presentation designing and social media graphics.

* 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** Mastering **Adobe Premiere Pro** for professional video editing, and exploring motion graphics with **Canva**. I'm also diving deep into color theory and typography.

* 🤝 **I’m looking to collaborate on:** Creative projects, social media campaigns, and design-focused roles in future hackathons.

* 💬 **Ask me about:** My design process, video editing basics, creating engaging content with Canva, or brainstorming visual ideas!

* 📫 **How to reach me:** Connect with me via **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naitik-nigotiya/)**.

* ⚡ **Fun fact:** I believe the right visual can tell a story more powerfully than a thousand words!
